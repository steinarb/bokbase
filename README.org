* Bokbase

This is a webapp that implements a simple book database intended to create goodreads-compatible csv files for use in [[https://bookwyrm.social/import][imports to bookwyrm]].

Data storage is in a PostgreSQL database and there is a simple react.js GUI to edit books, import calibre metadata, and export [[https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8251/codebooks/goodreads.html][goodreads style CSV files]].

To give users access to the database, add the [[https://shiro.apache.org/authorization.html#Authorization-Roles][shiro role]] bokbaseuser to the user in [[https://github.com/steinarb/authservice][authservice]].

** Development status
[[https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/sampleapp][file:https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/bokbase.svg?branch=master]]

** Installing the bokbase application

Give the following commands to the karaf console:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  feature:repo-add mvn:no.priv.bang.bokbase/karaf/LATEST/xml/features
  feature:install bokbase-with-derby
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Configuring a new default locale

Out of the box, the sample application supports two locales: nb_NO (Norwegian bokm√•l) and en_GB (UK English).

The locale texts are provided by a Java resource bundle, and new languages can be added by adding them to the bundle and to the available locales returned by the BokbaseService.

The default locale is nb_NO.

It is possible to persistently configuring the default locale to en_GB with the following commands in the karaf console command line:
#+begin_example
  config:edit no.priv.bang.bokbase.backend.BokbaseServiceProvider
  config:property-set defaultlocale en_GB
  config:update
#+end_example

/Note/! The name of the config file will change when the package name and classname of the class changes in a new application based on this one, so adjust the command example accordingly.
